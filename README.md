Crafting a robust Verilog-based CPU involves weaving multiplexers, adders, and an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) into an intricate tapestry. These components unify within modules, encapsulating the CPU pipeline's diverse phases—particularly instruction fetch, decode, and execution.

### Core Elements:

Multiplexers: Steering efficient data routing via 1-bit and multi-bit multiplexers, streamlining internal CPU operations.

Adders: Addressing addition intricacies with 1-bit and 32-bit adders, including provisions for carry signals.

Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Merging multiplexers, adders, and logic gates to empower the ALU with comprehensive arithmetic and logic prowess.

### Pipeline Focus:

Within, modules dedicated to instruction fetch, decode, and execution orchestrate key tasks. This ranges from memory instruction retrieval, decoding intricacies, managing registers, to executing diverse arithmetic and logic operations.

### Testbench Validation:

The project’s resilience hinges on meticulous testbench integration. Testbenches serve as validation mechanisms, affirming code correctness and optimizing its efficiency.
